# PHP Job Board

This is a beginner-level PHP job board application that Iâ€™m building to practice PHP and MySQL.  
Currently, it displays a list of job postings with dummy data on the front page.  

## Features planned
- View job listings  
- View job details  
- Admin login and job management (add/edit/delete)  
- Database integration with MySQL  

This project helps me learn PHP basics and how to connect PHP with a database.
